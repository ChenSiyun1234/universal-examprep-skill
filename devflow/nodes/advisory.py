"""Advisory phase nodes — create an advisory issue, ask Codex for an advisory, wait for it
(bounded poll in real mode), and summarize it.

Dry-run mode (default): GitHub writes are logged no-ops and the Codex advisory is simulated.
Real mode (``state['real_github']``): the create/comment go through the guarded ``GitHubWriter``
and the wait node polls real issue comments via ``ReadOnlyGitHub`` with a bounded number of tries.
