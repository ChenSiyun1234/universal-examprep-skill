"""LangGraph compatibility shim.

If ``langgraph`` is installed, the orchestrator uses a real ``StateGraph`` with native
``interrupt()`` human-in-the-loop pauses. If it is not installed (the repo is stdlib-only and
declares langgraph only as an *optional dev dependency*), a tiny pure-stdlib runner provides the
same behaviour so the CLI and tests work out of the box.

This module isolates the detection + the interrupt primitive so node modules don't import
langgraph directly (and to avoid import cycles with :mod:`devflow.graph`).
