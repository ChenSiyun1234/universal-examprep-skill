"""Typed workflow state for the devflow orchestrator.

The state is a ``TypedDict`` so it works directly as a LangGraph state schema. List-valued
fields are annotated with an ``operator.add`` reducer so concurrent / sequential node updates
*append* rather than overwrite — LangGraph honours these reducers natively, and the pure-stdlib
fallback runner in :mod:`devflow.graph` reads the same annotations to merge identically.

Nothing here performs side effects; it only describes the shape of the data that flows through
the graph.
