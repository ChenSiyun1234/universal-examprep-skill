# devflow — LangGraph development-workflow orchestrator (dry-run scaffold)

`devflow/` is a small orchestrator that models how a change moves through this repository:
advisory → implement → review → merge, with human approval gates and Codex (AI reviewer)
interactions. **This first PR is a dry-run scaffold only**: it builds the graph, runs mock nodes,
simulates Codex responses, and prints a report. It performs **no** real GitHub mutations, network
calls, or AI-provider API calls.

## How this differs from the Exam Prep product runtime

| | Exam Prep product (the skill) | devflow (this package) |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Help a student cram for an exam | Automate *development of this repo* |
| Audience | End users / students | Maintainers / CI |
| Runtime deps | Pure Python stdlib (no pip) | stdlib by default; LangGraph optional (dev only) |
| Side effects | Reads/writes the user's study workspace | *Would* touch GitHub — but disabled in this PR |

devflow is **developer tooling**, not part of the product. It must never be imported by, or add
dependencies to, the Exam Prep runtime.

State is a typed `TypedDict` (`devflow/state.py`). List fields (`event_log`, `errors`,
`blocking_comments`, `files_changed`, …) use an `operator.add` reducer so node updates *append*;
scalar fields are last-write-wins. The fallback runner reads the same annotations so both backends
merge identically. Key fields: `task_type, thread_id, repo, branch_name, issue_number, issue_url,
pr_number, pr_url, codex_advisory_status, codex_review_status, advisory_packet, review_summary,
blocking_comments, non_blocking_comments, deferred_followups, human_approval, merge_approval,
checks_run, checks_not_run, files_changed, errors, event_log`.

## Two interchangeable backends

`devflow/graph.py:build_graph()` returns either:

* **LangGraph backend** — used automatically if `langgraph` is importable. Builds a real
  `StateGraph`, compiles it with a `MemorySaver` checkpointer, and pauses at approval gates with
  native `interrupt()` (resumed via `Command(resume=...)`).
* **Fallback backend** — pure stdlib (the default here, since langgraph is an *optional* dev dep).
  A deterministic runner walks the same node/edge map and pauses by raising `DevflowInterrupt`.

Both expose `.invoke(state)` and the same nodes/routing, so behaviour is identical; only the
interrupt/checkpoint machinery differs.

The CLI **defaults to the stdlib backend** (fully supported). The real LangGraph backend is
opt-in and experimental via `--langgraph` (`pip install langgraph`); when selected, the CLI passes
a `config={"configurable": {"thread_id": …}}` so its `MemorySaver` checkpointer works, and the
fallback runner sets `_force_fallback` so approval gates always use `DevflowInterrupt` rather than
LangGraph's native `interrupt()` when running under the stdlib backend. `DevflowState` declares all
control channels (`fix_approval`, `merge_readiness_ready`, `rereview_done`, `_simulate`, …) so the
real `StateGraph` does not drop them. An explicit `pause_at` always pauses its gate, even if an
approval was seeded. `merge_readiness` requires a **completed** (re-)review — never merge-ready while
a re-review is only "requested".

## How human approval gates work

There are three gates, each calling `request_human_decision(...)` **exactly once per node
invocation** (one interrupt per node — never inside a loop):

1. **advisory implementation** (`human_approval`)
2. **blocking fix** (`human_fix_approval`)
3. **merge** (`human_merge_approval`)

A decision is resolved by (a) a value pre-seeded in `state["approvals"][gate]` — the dry-run policy
or the resume payload — otherwise (b) the workflow pauses: a real `interrupt()` under LangGraph, or
a `DevflowInterrupt` in fallback mode. A rejected gate routes to a safe stop. Approve/reject is never
inferred; the run halts until a decision is supplied.

## What is dry-run in this PR (hard boundaries)

The scaffold **does not**: create GitHub issues, post `@codex` comments, create branches/PRs, push,
or merge; it does not edit product files, add LangGraph to the product runtime, or make any
Claude/Codex/OpenAI/Anthropic API calls. `devflow/tools/github_cli.py` is the single chokepoint for
GitHub operations and every method is a recorded no-op (`executed: False`). `run_checks` does **not**
execute checks and therefore never claims any passed — it records them under `checks_not_run`.
No secrets, no API keys, no paid CI, no GitHub Actions.

## Usage

```bash
# end-to-end dry-run (all gates auto-approved) -> prints a final report
python -m devflow.cli run --task docs-advisory --thread-id demo-1

# demonstrate a human-approval pause (interrupt) then resume
python -m devflow.cli run    --task docs-advisory --thread-id demo-2 --pause-at advisory
python -m devflow.cli resume --thread-id demo-2 --gate advisory --decision approved

# safe-stop routes
python -m devflow.cli run --task docs-advisory --thread-id demo-3 --reject merge
python -m devflow.cli run --task docs-advisory --thread-id demo-4 --simulate-review clean
python -m devflow.cli run --task docs-advisory --thread-id demo-5 --simulate-advisory timeout
```

Tests: `python -m unittest tests.test_devflow_graph`

## Read-only GitHub integration

`devflow/tools/github_cli.py` has two clearly separated layers:

* **Write layer** (`DryRunGitHub`) — issue/PR/branch/merge operations are recorded no-ops in this
  scaffold (`executed: False`).
* **Read-only layer** (`ReadOnlyGitHub` + `check_gh_available()`) — inspects issues, PRs, comments
  and reviews via the `gh` CLI. **Strictly read-only.** Every `gh` invocation passes through
  `_assert_read_only()`, the single safety chokepoint, which:
  * allow-lists only read shapes (`gh auth status`, `gh repo view`, `gh issue view`, `gh pr view`,
    `gh pr/issue list`, `gh pr diff`, and `gh api`);
  * refuses `gh api` with a write method (`-X POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE`) or write-style field flags
    (`-f/--field/-F/--raw-field/--input` — which would make `gh api` POST);
  * runs **before** any subprocess is spawned, so a write-shaped command never executes.

There is no code path in the read-only layer that can create, comment, push, or merge.

### Functions

* `check_gh_available()` → `{available, authenticated, account, error}` (never raises)
* `ReadOnlyGitHub(repo=None).get_repo_info()`
* `.get_issue_comments(issue_number)` / `.get_pr_comments(pr_number)` / `.get_pr_reviews(pr_number)`
* `.find_latest_codex_advisory(issue_number)` — newest comment authored by a Codex account
* `.find_latest_codex_review(pr_number)` — newest Codex PR comment/review, with a light
  `blocking` heuristic (CHANGES_REQUESTED or "blocking/must fix" language) and parsed bullet items

Codex authorship is matched against an **exact trusted-login allowlist** (e.g.
`chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]`, `codex`) — not a loose "contains codex/chatgpt" check — so a
look-alike login on a public repo can't spoof the integration. Paginated reads use
`gh api --paginate --slurp` so multi-page results stay valid JSON, and PR reviews include inline
(file-level) review comments with the strongest review state preserved.

### Prerequisite (local)

An **authenticated `gh` CLI** is required for the read commands:

```bash
gh --version        # GitHub CLI installed
gh auth login       # one-time authentication
```

If `gh` is missing or unauthenticated, the read commands print a clear error and exit non-zero
(they never fall back to anything that mutates state).

### Examples

```bash
python -m devflow.cli github-check
python -m devflow.cli read-issue --issue 123 [--repo owner/name]
python -m devflow.cli read-pr    --pr 456     [--repo owner/name]
```

`--repo` defaults to the current repository. Tests for this layer mock `gh` entirely
(`tests/test_devflow_github_readonly.py`): they assert no write command can run, that a Codex
advisory/review is detected/parsed from sample comments/reviews, and that gh-unavailable errors
are clear.

## GitHub write mode (guarded, opt-in)

`GitHubWriter` adds the only *write* path devflow has. It is **off by default** and limited to four
operations — there is no merge, branch-delete, or force-push capability anywhere in the class.

| Capability | `create_advisory_issue` | `comment_on_issue` | `create_draft_pr` | `comment_on_pr` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| present | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (always `--draft`) | ✅ |

| **NOT present** | merge | branch delete | push / force-push | close/admin |

### Dry-run vs real mode

* **Dry-run (default, `real_github=False`)** — every write logs exactly what it *would* run
  (`[github-write:DRY-RUN] … :: gh issue create …`) and returns a simulated number/URL. Nothing is
  sent to GitHub; no `gh` subprocess is spawned.
* **Real mode (`real_github=True`, CLI `--real-github`)** — the four operations run real, guarded
  `gh` commands. Every command passes `_assert_write_allowed()` (allow-list of create/comment only;
  refuses any `merge`/`delete`/`--force`/`push` token) **and** `_assert_no_secrets()` (refuses
  content that looks like a token/key). Failures are returned as `{executed: False, error: …}` —
  the workflow fails safely rather than crashing.

### Bounded waiting (no infinite loops)

`wait_for_codex_advisory` / `wait_for_codex_review` poll via the read-only layer using
`bounded_poll(fetch, max_attempts, sleep_seconds)` — capped attempts, configurable sleep, default
small (`--max-polls 6 --poll-seconds 30`). On exhaustion they set a `timeout` status and a clear
error; they never loop forever. `--max-polls 0` means "do not poll" (immediate timeout), negative
`--poll-seconds` is rejected at the CLI, and the wait nodes refuse to poll issue/PR `#0` (a failed
create stops the run safely instead of acting on the wrong number).

**Resume safety:** a paused `--real-github` run resumes in **dry-run by default**; live writes must
be re-requested with `--real-github` on the `resume` command, so they can never silently persist
across a human-approval pause.

### Codex issue handoff (advisory)

1. `create_advisory_issue` opens an issue (real or simulated).
2. `request_codex_advisory` posts an `@codex …` comment asking for an advisory.
3. `wait_for_codex_advisory` bounded-polls the issue's comments for a Codex-authored reply
   (`find_latest_codex_advisory`).
4. `summarize_advisory` condenses it; `human_approval` **interrupts for approval before any repo
   edits**. Approval is never inferred.

### PR review handoff

1. `create_draft_pr` opens a draft PR; `request_codex_review` posts `@codex review …`.
2. `wait_for_codex_review` bounded-polls PR comments/reviews (`find_latest_codex_review`), with a
   light blocking/items parse.
3. Blocking comments route to `human_fix_approval`; clean reviews skip the fix gate.

### CLI

```bash
# dry-run (safe; no writes): create(sim) -> @codex(sim) -> simulate advisory -> summarize -> pause
python -m devflow.cli run-docs-advisory --thread-id demo

# REAL mode: real issue + @codex comment, bounded wait, then PAUSE at human approval (no edits)
python -m devflow.cli run-docs-advisory --real-github --max-polls 6 --poll-seconds 30 \
    --repo owner/name --thread-id demo
```

This PR stops at the human-approval summary: it never applies advisory changes, opens nothing past
the issue/comment, and never merges.

### Exact safety boundaries (this PR)

Never: merge a PR · delete a branch · force-push · push a branch · add GitHub Actions · add
secrets/API keys · implement product runtime · auto-apply a Codex advisory without human approval.

## Dependency note

The repo has no product dependency file and the product is intentionally stdlib-only. To avoid
silently changing that strategy, LangGraph is declared as an **optional dev dependency** scoped to
this tool in `devflow/requirements-dev.txt`. devflow runs fully without it (stdlib fallback);
installing it only upgrades the orchestrator to the real LangGraph backend.

## Planned next PRs

1. ~~Read-only GitHub integration~~ — **done** (`ReadOnlyGitHub` + `check_gh_available`).
2. ~~GitHub issue/PR write integration + Codex polling~~ — **done** (`GitHubWriter`, `--real-github`,
   `bounded_poll`; create issue / @codex comment / draft PR / bounded wait — no merge).
3. **Apply approved advisory changes** — real repo edits after the human-approval gate (still no
   merge), behind explicit confirmation.
4. **Merge approval execution** — wire `claude_execute_merge` to a real, human-approved merge
   (the only step that can merge; deliberately absent today).
